            <p>At the start of the game you will be shown a random number</p>
            <br>
            <p>Below are four crystals. Each crystal has a randomly assigned value and by clicking one that value will be added to your total.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The value of the crystals will be hidden from you.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Your goal is to match your total with the random number shown at the begining.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If your total goes above the starting value, you lose.</p>
